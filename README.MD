## Omarchy Mac OS
This is an attempt to replicate how omarchy looks and feels on MacOS. Primarily the matte-black theme. 

### Alacritty 
This is the terminal of choice. 

### Hammerspoon
This is used for keybindings to open apps with shortcuts. 

### Zen Browser
The Browser of choice is Zen Browser. 
> If there is an already open instance of zen in one desktop and and you try to open it in another it takes you to the the previous (already open instance).

> You can fix this ***system settings -> desktop and dock -> scroll all the way down -> mission control -> unselect (when switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application)***
